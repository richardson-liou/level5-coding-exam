		 * 2. The color of the shapes
		 * 3. How many sides each shape will have
		 * 
		 * Once the information has been collected, the program will then make the requested number of robots
		 * each draw the requested shape in the requested color. The robots should execute at the same time so 
		 * Threads will need to be used. Arrange the robots so that the shapes do not overlap.
		 * For full credit, define the Thread functions using lambdas.
		 * 
		 * See the Coding_Exam_A_Demo.jar for an example of what the finished product should look like.
